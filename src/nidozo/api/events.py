    """Publish battle events; each subscriber gets its own bounded queue.

    **Replay buffer** — subscribers that connect after a battle has started
    (the common case for P1's draft phase) receive an immediate replay of
    structural events since the most recent ``battle_start``.  This ensures
    the draft overlay appears for both players even when the WebSocket
    connection races the background task.  The buffer is cleared on each
    ``battle_start`` so stale events from previous battles are never replayed.

    Only events in ``_REPLAY_TYPES`` are buffered; high-frequency per-turn
    events (``turn``, ``state_update``, etc.) are excluded to prevent
    duplicates in the action log on reconnect.

    If a subscriber's queue is full (e.g. a slow or dead WebSocket), the
    oldest buffered event is silently dropped to make room for the new one.
    This prevents a stuck client from growing memory without bound.
