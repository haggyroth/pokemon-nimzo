"""Spectator-stream proxy for the Showdown battle-scene renderer (OP-02, #84).

This endpoint connects to the local Pokémon Showdown server as a **guest
spectator**, joins one battle room, and relays the raw Showdown text protocol
to a single browser client.  The browser renders it with a vendored copy of
Showdown's own ``Battle`` class (see ``docs/op-02-architecture.md``).

Design principles
-----------------
* **Dumb proxy.** It performs guest auth + ``/join`` + verbatim relay only.  It
  does *not* parse battle protocol, so it stays robust to Showdown protocol
  changes.  Frames are forwarded exactly as received (including the leading
  ``>ROOMID`` line); the frontend strips that and feeds ``|...`` lines to the
  renderer.
* **Read-only.** A spectator never sends moves, so nothing is forwarded
  browser → upstream except connection teardown.
* **Sandboxed target.** The ``room`` path param is validated against a strict
  ``battle-*`` pattern so this can never be used to join arbitrary rooms or as
  an SSRF pivot — it only ever talks to the configured Showdown host.
* **Additive.** This is entirely separate from the ``/ws/battles`` JSON bus.
  ELO, logging, analysis, and the existing visualizer are untouched.

The upstream connection is injectable (``connect_upstream``) so the proxy is
fully unit-testable against a scripted fake — no live Showdown server required.
