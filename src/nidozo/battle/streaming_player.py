"""StreamingPlayer — wraps any Player subclass and pushes battle events to the EventBus.

Zero-lag state updates (OP-01)
------------------------------
Pokémon Showdown delivers each ``>battle-…`` update as one WebSocket frame, which
poke-env turns into a single ``_handle_battle_message`` call. Crucially, the
turn-resolution frame (``|move|``, ``|-damage|``, …, ``|turn|N|``) and the next
``|request|`` arrive as *separate* frames. poke-env only invokes ``choose_move``
when the request frame is parsed — so emitting battle state purely from
``choose_move`` leaves the UI stale for the gap between the two frames, and never
reflects intermediate changes (faints, forced switches) until the next decision.

We close this by hooking ``_handle_battle_message``: we let poke-env parse the
frame as usual (``super()`` — so all the fragile protocol handling stays in the
library), then, if that frame changed visible state but did **not** result in a
``choose_move`` call, we publish a render-only ``state_update`` immediately. The
battlefield therefore refreshes the instant Showdown resolves a turn, regardless
of whose turn comes next.

The emit is render-only (``serialize_battle(light=True)``): it carries HP, status,
active/bench Pokémon, weather and fields, but not the heuristic advisory or legal
actions — those are both expensive and stale until poke-env parses the request.
The frontend preserves the last full turn's advisory when it merges these in.
