# Roadmap

## Completed

### v0.1 — Foundation
- Repo scaffold, Python project, venv, pyproject.toml
- Local Pokémon Showdown server wired up with poke-env
- Two RandomBots complete a Gen 3 random singles battle end to end

### v0.2 — LLM Decision Layer
- Pluggable model backend: Anthropic + OpenAI cloud APIs
- Local model support via LM Studio (OpenAI-compatible API)
- Battle state serializer with hidden-information enforcement
- System prompt v1: battle state format, legal actions, `ACTION: move N` output schema
- Versioned prompts for correlating changes with ELO shifts
- `LLMPlayer` full loop: state → prompt → backend → action parser → `BattleOrder`

### v0.3 — Heuristic Engine
- Type effectiveness, estimated damage %, stat stages, priority, status annotation
- Switch matchup scoring
- Heuristic scores surfaced to LLM as advisory context (not a hard filter)

### v0.4 — ELO & Persistence
- SQLite schema: battles, turns, elo_ratings, elo_history, models, prompt versions
- ELO calculation (K=32) updated after each battle
- Per-model stats, turn logging, leaderboard CLI

### v0.5 — API & Visualizer
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket live-battle feed (`/ws/battles`)
- REST endpoints: leaderboard, battles, turns, start-battle
- React + Vite frontend: retro CRT dark-theme battlefield visualizer
- Live Pokémon cards with animated HP bars, type badges, status, stat boosts
- Battle log, heuristic advisory drawer, winner banner

### v0.6 — Post-game Analysis
- Per-turn decision quality annotation: optimal / good / suboptimal / fallback
- Analysis compares chosen action against heuristic ranking
- `/api/battles/{id}/analysis` endpoint
- Analysis panel in the UI with quality bars and turn-by-turn breakdown

### v0.7 — Tournament Runner & Real Battles
- Round-robin tournament CLI (`scripts/tournament.py`)
- Per-player model fields in API and UI
- First live LLM battles: Ministral-3-3b vs Granite-4-h-tiny (12-0 result)
- Parser hardened for name-based actions and markdown-wrapped output
- Leaderboard SQL bug fixed (duplicate rows from UNION ALL)

### v0.8 — JSON Outputs, Engine Reliability, UI Polish
- **v2 prompt**: JSON structured output (`{"reasoning","action_type","identifier"}`)
- LM Studio `response_format=json_schema` for grammar-sampled valid JSON
- `reasoning_content` fallback for Qwen 3 thinking models
- Fuzzy species name matching (`difflib`, cutoff=0.82) for switch typos
- Retry on empty LLM response; logs `finish_reason` for diagnosis
- Thinking events: amber pulsing indicator while model reasons
- Gen 3 sprites via Showdown CDN with pixelated rendering
- Bench row: reserve Pokémon with mini-sprites + HP bars
- Model selector queries LM Studio's `/v1/models` for live chips
- WebSocket keepalive pings (25s) — eliminates reconnection churn
- CI pipeline: ruff lint + pytest + frontend build in parallel
- 127 tests including full API endpoint coverage
- Leaderboard grouped by model (aggregates across prompt versions; `v1`/`v2` pill tags)
- First meaningful ELO results: gemma-4-e2b 7-3 vs ministral-3-3b

### v0.9 — Live Pipeline, Replay, Visual Polish & Richer Analysis
- **Live pipeline**: all battles (UI or CLI) routed through the shared EventBus; tournament progress visible in real time
- **Tournament UI**: configure N players and rounds in the browser; cancel individual battles mid-run; live progress bar + final standings overlay
- **Battle Replay**: step through any completed battle turn by turn; HP timeline SVG; scrub slider; keyboard nav (← → Space Esc); auto-play
- **Type-themed card backgrounds**: 18-type colour map; single-type corner wash; dual-type diagonal gradient split
- **Battle animations**: hit flash, sprite shake, heal pulse, faint fade — driven by HP delta tracking with `useRef`
- **Win probability timeline**: team HP ratio per turn; sparkline in analysis drawer and replay HP chart
- **Turning-point detection**: turn with the largest single-turn win-prob swing, highlighted in both replay and analysis
- **Blunder flagging**: suboptimal moves where score gap ≥ 40% of best option flagged with `⚠`; blunders panel in analysis
- **RNG inference**: possible crit / possible miss inferred from actual vs expected HP drop; badges in replay and analysis log
- 154 tests; parser fix for `"switch 1"` identifier form

### v0.10 — Hardening, Quality & Technical Debt
- **Wave R1 — Critical correctness fixes**: test suite stabilised; port 5001 enforced consistently across serve.py, vite config, and README
- **Wave R2 — Frontend lint + CI gate**: all 16 ESLint v10 / react-hooks v7 errors resolved; `npm run lint` added to CI; pytest coverage gate at 65%; `uv.lock` committed for reproducible builds
- **Wave R3 — Robustness**: `failed` battle status wired end-to-end; Pydantic `Field(ge/le)` bounds on all API inputs (422 on bad requests); 6 DB indexes for hot read paths; `finish_battle` + ELO update made fully atomic; CORS restricted to known origins; EventBus queues bounded (256) with drop-oldest overflow; events list capped at 500 in frontend
- **Wave R4 — Test coverage**: 35 new tests across `LLMPlayer`, `StreamingLLMPlayer`, `StreamingRandomBot`, `AnthropicBackend`, `OpenAIBackend`, `BattleStore`, and schema migrations; overall coverage 85%; schema migration bug found and fixed (`migrate()` would crash on v1 databases due to index creation before column existed)
- **Technical debt cleared**: heuristic bogus tokens removed; `AnthropicBackend` multi-block crash fixed; opponent `ability` hidden-info guard; inline SQL moved to `BattleStore`; `serve.py --reload` fixed
- 203 tests

### v0.11 — Memory, Intelligence, Drafted Teams & Deep Analysis
- **Cross-battle lessons**: after each battle the LLM generates a short lesson (what worked, what to avoid); stored per model in SQLite; injected into future system prompts so models evolve strategy across battles
- **Per-model stats page**: full W/L/T history, ELO sparkline, opponent breakdown, decision-quality distribution, lesson log — all in-browser
- **Richer post-game analysis**: per-turn key moments list (blunders, RNG events, turning point); enhanced lesson generation grounded in specific blunders; `AnalysisSummary` panel in Battle Replay with clickable moments that seek to the turn
- **Tournament mode**: configure N models and rounds in the browser; round-robin; live progress + standings overlay; cancel individual battles mid-run; full tournament history page
- **Drafted teams + Smogon meta tiers**: LLM snake-drafts a 6-mon team from a curated pool; 8 tier formats (Random / OU / UU / NU / LC / Ubers / Freeforall); DraftPhase UI with animated pick reveal; `teams` table in DB; drafted team rosters shown on post-battle result card
- **Tier context in UI**: tier badges throughout battlefield, leaderboard, tournament scoreboard; tier filter tabs on leaderboard
- **Heuristic overhaul**: speed-tier awareness (Gen 3 paralysis ×0.25), weather damage modifier, accuracy-adjusted damage estimates, low-PP warnings, battle context block (matchup quality, remaining counts, status impact), switch quality scoring with matchup labels
- **Draft critique**: team composition analysis — STAB offensive type spread, shared defensive weaknesses (Gen 3 type chart), coverage gaps, execution quality (blunders + decision_quality_pct)
- **Variance report**: structured tally of all inferred RNG events (crits + misses) with per-player benefit counts and plain-English verdict; new `VarianceReport` and `DraftCritiqueSection` panels in Battle Replay
- **Gen 3 pool expansion**: 93 → 153 species with Smogon ADV competitive sets covering all missing starters (Blaziken, Charizard, Venusaur, Blastoise), legends (Raikou, Entei, Regirock, Registeel), and popular UU/NU picks; all Gen 3 legal (no Gen 4+ moves)
- 358 tests; mypy strict enforced across all source files

### v0.12 — Coach Mode, Brackets & Richer Lessons
- **Multi-agent coach mode**: optional pre-turn coach model queries the same battle state with no output constraints; coach advice appended to player prompt; `agent: "coach"|"player"` thinking events in the UI; `coach_advice` column in turns table (schema v8)
- **Tournament brackets**: single-elimination and double-elimination bracket modes with seeded byes for non-power-of-2 fields; lazy battle creation; `bracket_update` WebSocket event; `BracketView` UI with bracket progression visualizer; `tournament_format` and `bracket_state` columns (schema v7)
- **Richer lesson prompting**: draft critique, variance report, and win-probability data now fully surfaced in the lesson prompt; lesson grounded in specific blunders and turning-point turns rather than generic reflection
- **Tier 1 test coverage**: 564 tests at 88% coverage; targeted unit tests for analyzer, heuristics, bracket, store, schema, serializer, action parser, and API routes

### v0.13 — Prompt v4, Head-to-Head Matrix & Stability
- **Prompt v4**: battle event history (last 3 turns of HP deltas), opponent moveset revelation count, pre-computed threat map per threatened Pokémon
- **Head-to-head matchup matrix**: win/loss/tie counts for every model pair; tier-filterable
- **Double-elimination bye fix**: fixed-point resolver handles chained bye slots
- **Tournament failure handling**: unhandled exceptions abort bracket, mark failed, emit `tournament_failed` event
- **ELO idempotency**: `finish_battle` fully idempotent with `AND finished_at IS NULL` guard; `UNIQUE(battle_id, model_id)` index enforced at DB level (schema v9)
- **`app.py` split**: refactored into `lifespan.py` and `middleware.py`; tier-2 async test coverage (53 tests) for the API layer

### v0.14 — Seasons
- **Named competition seasons**: fixed participant list, round-robin scheduling across N rounds, per-season isolated ELO ratings
- **Season UI**: live standings page with progress bar, per-season battle history, start/cancel from the browser
- **Schema v10**: `seasons` and `season_battles` tables

### v0.15 — Prompt v5
- **Decision framework & KO-risk signal**: actual computed stats (Spe/Atk/SpA/Def/SpD) for own active Pokémon; last move used for both sides; KO-risk note injected when either side can OHKO; explicit decision-ordering framework in system prompt
- Default prompt version bumped to `v5`

### v0.16 — Richer Post-Game Analysis
- **LLM battle narrative**: `narrator.py` generates a 4–6 sentence battle story; stored in `battles.narrative` (schema v11); "Battle Story" section in Battle Replay
- **Switch quality classification**: `good_switch` / `bad_switch` / `neutral_switch` / `forced_switch` labels using heuristic switch scores; per-player switch breakdown in analysis summary
- **Enriched turning-point description**: includes move names and win-probability swing

### v0.17 — UI Intelligence & Parser Hardening
- **Model name labels**: provider + model name above each Pokémon card (P1 cyan, P2 amber)
- **Own-mon move display**: active card shows all 4 moves with type-color dot, BP, and PP (red when low)
- **Model dropdowns**: `<select>` with LM Studio live models + static Anthropic/OpenAI presets; Claude Sonnet 4, Haiku 3.5, Opus 4, o4-mini added
- **`<think>` block stripping**: parser strips `<think>...</think>` from reasoning-model responses before JSON parse

### v0.18 — Battle Scene Responsiveness
- **Turn-start state_update**: emitted at the top of `choose_move` (request parsed, stats fresh) so the battlefield refreshes immediately before LLM think-time; eliminates stale-HP window between turns

### v0.19 — Pokémon Mouseover Tooltips
- **Tooltip panel**: hovering any active or bench Pokémon shows base stat bars (color-coded), Gen 3 type matchup table grouped by multiplier, and revealed ability/item
- Base stats added to opponent serializer (Pokédex-public knowledge, no hidden-info violation)

### v0.20 — Rich Stats Dashboard
- **Global stats page**: summary KPIs, battles by tier, top Pokémon, top moves, recent battles feed
- **Per-model stats expanded**: Pokémon/move usage lists, action distribution stacked bar, win-rate-by-tier panel
- Backend uses `json_extract()` to mine `turns.state_json` at the SQL layer

### v0.21 — UI Polish
- Type badges + PP in heuristic advisory drawer
- Client-side leaderboard search/filter; copy model ID button
- Win-streak column (🔥N, pulses orange at ≥3)
- Battle log keyword filter; press R / REPLAY button from winner banner
- Pokéball favicon

### v0.22 — Zero-Lag State Updates (OP-01)
- **`_StreamingMixin._handle_battle_message` hook**: emits a render-only `state_update` the instant Showdown resolves a turn frame, before the next `|request|` arrives; battlefield HP bars update immediately on turn resolution rather than waiting for the next decision
- `serialize_battle(light=True)` for cheap render-only snapshots (omits heuristics/threat-map/legal-actions); frontend merges `state_update` to preserve last advisory

### v0.23 — Bug Fix Batch
- **SQLite threading**: per-thread connections via `threading.local()` fix concurrent `InterfaceError` / `IndexError` on page load
- **Non-draft non-random team rejection**: auto-generate random preset teams when `draft=false` in a non-random tier instead of sending `|/utm null`
- **P1 draft screen missing**: EventBus replay buffer ensures late-joining WebSocket subscribers receive all structural events since `battle_start`
- **Baton Pass ban**: removed from 6 gen3ubers-incompatible movesets
- **Challenge hang**: 60 s timeout on `_battle_semaphore.acquire()` converts infinite hangs to clean `failed` status

### v0.24 — Showdown Built-in Battle Scene (OP-02)
- **Spectator-proxy WebSocket** (`/ws/showdown/{room}`): guest login + `/join` + verbatim frame relay to the browser; room ids validated against a strict `battle-*` pattern; login frames suppressed; injectable upstream for unit testing
- **`showdown_room` EventBus event**: emitted on the first battle frame so the frontend learns the Showdown room id; included in the replay buffer for late-joining subscribers
- **PS bundle loader** (`useShowdownBundle`): fetches 14 CDN scripts from `play.pokemonshowdown.com` in strict dependency order; singleton load promise; `window.Config` stub injected first
- **`ShowdownBattleScene`**: opens the spectator-proxy socket after the PS `Battle` instance is ready; Showdown server replay eliminates any line-buffer requirement
- **Classic / Showdown toggle**: tab bar in the live battle view; defaults to Classic; `localStorage`-persisted preference; graceful fallback to Classic when no room is available yet
- **Integration test gate**: `pytest.mark.integration` marker; `test_proxy_relays_init_battle_and_turn_frames` creates a real Gen 3 battle and asserts the proxy relays `|init|battle` + `|turn|`; excluded from the default test run via `addopts`
- Small fixes: LM Studio stats `json_extract` guard (#95); model labels not cleared before next `battle_start` (#96)

### v0.25 — E2E Testing & Moveset Correctness
- **Playwright smoke suite**: full pipeline test — start battle → watch 5 turns via WebSocket → cancel → replay; headless Chromium; cancel-based design avoids stall-game timeouts; `npm run test:e2e`
- **React StrictMode purity fix**: `delete buf[n]` inside `setEvents` updater crashed on StrictMode's double-invocation; moved eviction to the ref before the pure updater
- **Vite proxy noise**: `ECONNRESET` + `EPIPE` added to the silent-error set so the dev terminal stays clean when the browser disconnects mid-stream
- **Illegal Gen3 moves removed**: Signal Beam (espeon → Baton Pass) and Iron Head (mawile → Rock Slide) are Gen 4+ and were rejected by Showdown's legality checker
- **Hidden Power IV spreads**: all 22 HP users now carry explicit `ivs` in `gen3_movesets.json`; without them Showdown defaulted to all-31 (= HP Dark); all 7 types now emit at max power (70 BP); `build_pokemon_block` extended with `IVs:` line support; 5 new tests verify type/power correctness

### v0.26 — Showdown Cockpit (rehab + made primary, #148)
- **Token foundation** (#149): spacing + type scales in `:root`; reusable `<EmptyState>` on leaderboard / recent battles / global stats
- **Rehab baseline** (#150): PS `battle.css` loaded via `<link>` in `useShowdownBundle` (root cause of "no HP bars / janky scene" — it was never loaded); fixed 640×400 centred stage; cockpit shell (header strip + stage + log)
- **Data parity** (#151, #153): model labels per side, win-probability bar, heuristic advisory (move scores + type badges + PP), thinking badge — all extracted into shared `battleShared.jsx` so Classic and the cockpit can't drift
- **Log contrast fix** (#153): override PS's light-on-light `h2.battle-history` turn headers so they're legible on the dark cockpit
- **Lifecycle chrome shared** (`battleChrome.jsx`): cancel control, winner banner, tournament progress bar, tournament-end overlay, and tier/draft badges lifted out of `BattleField` to wrap *both* stages — App.jsx owns the overlays; each stage renders the inline controls
- **Showdown is now the default view**; Classic remains available behind the toggle as a zero-cost fallback (`nidozo-battle-view` localStorage default flipped to `showdown`)

## Upcoming

### Player Experience

**Personality Profiles**
- Named play-style personas (Aggressive, Defensive, Balanced, Trickster, etc.) selectable per player
- Persona injected into the system prompt to shape reasoning style and risk appetite
- Profiles stored per model; switchable per battle or tournament

**Party Presets — Trainer Themes**
- Curated 6-mon teams inspired by trainer archetypes and notable in-game characters (Gym Leaders, Elite Four, rivals)
- Selectable alongside random and draft modes in the battle form
- Preset metadata: trainer name, flavour text, Gen-legal moveset validation

**Human Player Mode**
- Allow a human to take one side of a battle via the browser
- Move/switch selection UI replaces the model selector for the human slot
- Useful for testing heuristics and experiencing battles directly

**Achievements & Badges**
- Per-model milestone badges: first win, win streak ≥5, perfect game (no KO taken), upset win (vs higher ELO)
- Badge gallery on the per-model stats page
- Badge events emitted via WebSocket so they appear live in the UI

---

### UI & Visualisation

**Showdown Scene Expansion**
- Overlay heuristic scores and move type badges on the Showdown battle view (currently Classic-tab-only)
- Win-probability sparkline and live HP ratio in the Showdown tab
- Player name / model labels displayed above each side in the Showdown view (currently unlabelled)

**Stats Page Expansion**
- Global stats: damage-per-turn distribution, average battle length by tier, type usage heatmap
- Per-model: H2H matrix inline on the stats page; matchup efficiency (win rate vs type disadvantage)
- Export stats to CSV/JSON for offline analysis

**UI/UX Overhaul**
- Visual design pass across all pages: typography hierarchy, spacing system, animation polish
- Mobile-responsive layout (currently desktop-only)
- Dark/light theme toggle persisted to `localStorage`
- Onboarding empty states for leaderboard, battles list, and stats when no data exists yet

---

### Platform Expansion

**OP-03 — Gen 9 NatDex: One Format, Full Pokédex** *(#85 — revised scope)*

*Revised direction:* instead of maintaining per-generation rule sets (Gen 1/2/3 each needing their own type-chart, stat-model, and legality data), adopt **Gen 9 National Dex** as the single canonical ruleset. Any Pokémon from the full national Pokédex, any move it can legally learn in the current generation, no cross-gen legality juggling.

**Why this is better than the original OP-03 plan:**
- The root cause of the Signal Beam / Iron Head / Hidden Power IV failures was maintaining Gen 3 legality by hand — an unbounded maintenance surface
- Gen 9 moves and forms are a superset of all earlier gens; moves that were move-tutor-only in Gen 3 are straightforwardly legal
- Showdown validates Gen 9 teams automatically; we stop being an ad-hoc legality checker
- The `gen9nationaldexag` format (NatDex Anything Goes) is already live on our local Showdown server

**Showdown formats to use:**
- `gen9randombattle` — random tier (Showdown auto-generates teams, zero moveset data needed, immediate drop-in)
- `gen9nationaldexag` — drafted / freeforall tiers (full national dex, no ban list beyond true illegality)
- `gen9nationaldex` — competitive drafted tiers (NatDex OU bans apply)
- `gen9nationaldexlc` — Little Cup equivalent

**Implementation phases:**

*Phase 1 — Random battles (minimal change, no data needed):*
- Change `"gen3randombattle"` → `"gen9randombattle"` in `routes.py` (3 occurrences) and `tiers.py`
- Immediate payoff: Showdown generates legal Gen 9 teams automatically; zero moveset JSON involved

*Phase 2 — Moveset data overhaul:*
- Replace/extend `gen3_movesets.json` with a `movesets.json` covering the full national dex
- Sets source: Smogon Gen 9 NatDex competitive analyses or a script that pulls from poke-env `GenData.from_gen(9)`
- Each species entry: same schema (species, item, ability, nature, evs, ivs, moves) but Gen 9 legal
- IVs field already exists (added in v0.25); Hidden Power is gone in Gen 9 so the IV complexity disappears
- Script approach: query Showdown's own NatDex random-sets data (`data/random-battles/gen9/sets.json`)

*Phase 3 — Tier definitions:*
- Replace Gen 3 ADV tier sets in `tiers.py` with Gen 9 NatDex tier classifications (ND OU, ND UU, ND Ubers, etc.)
- Or simplify to fewer tiers: `freeforall` (NatDex AG), `ou` (NatDex OU), `ubers` (NatDex Ubers), `lc` (NatDex LC)
- TIER_TO_FORMAT updated to `gen9nationaldexag`, `gen9nationaldex`, etc.

*Phase 4 — Heuristics:*
- Remove Gen 3 specific comments; most mechanics (paralysis, burn, weather) are identical in Gen 9
- Add Fairy type to damage modifier lookups (18-type chart)
- Optionally: Terastal awareness (secondary type during Tera); safe to ignore in v1

*Phase 5 — Serializer + prompts:*
- Serializer already uses SpA/SpD (correct for Gen 9); minor audit for Gen 9-specific fields (Tera type)
- Prompt templates: remove "Gen 3" references, no functional change needed initially

**3v3 / 6v6 Team Size Config**
- Expose team size as a configurable battle option alongside tier and format
- Action parser and serializer updates for different team sizes

**Doubles Battles**
- 2v2 format with target selection
- Prompt and action parser extended for `target` field
- Heuristic engine updated for spread moves and partner synergy

**Deeper Competitive Features**
- Battle event annotation: item activations, ability procs, status cures inline in battle log and replay
- Speed tie and priority bracket resolution visible in the battle log

---

### Technical Debt & Housekeeping

**Fallback Move Investigation**
- Audit when and why `LLMPlayer` falls back to a random move (parse failure, timeout, invalid action)
- Log fallback events explicitly with reason; surface fallback rate in per-model stats
- Reduce fallback rate: improve parser robustness, tighten output schema enforcement

**File Logging**
- Structured file-based log output (JSON lines) alongside the current console logs
- Configurable log level and rotation; separate logs for battle events, LLM calls, and errors
- Useful for post-hoc debugging and offline analysis without a DB query

**Containerisation**
- `docker-compose.yml` for the full dev stack: Showdown server, FastAPI backend, Vite dev server
- Production Dockerfile: multi-stage build, static frontend served from FastAPI
- README updated with Docker-first quickstart

**Test Coverage**
- **Tier 3 (partial)** — `pytest.mark.integration` infrastructure is in place; `test_ws_showdown_integration.py` covers the spectator proxy. Still needed: integration tests for `battle/orchestration.py` and `llm/draft.py`; dedicated CI job that starts the Showdown server

**Infrastructure**
- Dependabot for Python and npm dependency updates
